# GH-to-RB2

A complete overhaul of the original GHtoRB project. Lot of minor details that were not in the original project are being converted properly in this overhaul.
Every song is built from the ground up and do not make use of any automated converting tools like Onyx, C3 Con Tools, or even Magma.
Some of the fine details included are:

* Properly converting GH's fret hand animations for Guitar and Bass
* Converting GH's camera cut and lighting trigger times for the venue
* Using the stems ripped directly from the game/DLC packages, or alternatively using a better mix when applicable
* Hand authored lipsyncing
* Better drum animations, and converting to a more accurate style RB drum chart
* Starpower/OD have all been rearranged to follow HMX's standards
* Vocal phrases and lyrics all follow HMX's standards
* Metadata pulled directly from GH's internal files, song ids from GH are somewhat kept intact
* Album art that share parity with existing RB songs are reused, so that they are consistent
* Charts/Gem generally stay the same, with only minor tweaks being made to account for such things like open bass strumming

**Games included in this project:**
* Guitar Hero II
* Guitar Hero III
* Guitar Hero: World Tour
* Guitar Hero 5
* Guitar Hero: Metallica
* Guitar Hero: Aerosmith
* Guitar Hero: Van Halen
* Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock
